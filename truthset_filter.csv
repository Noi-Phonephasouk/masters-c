22,"The addition of products such as Jira Agile brought the product to the new methodologies, along with Confluence, it is a very powerful option to manage the project lifecycle.",0

25,The marketplace is full of applications that extend the features of the system.,0
26,What do you dislike?,0
27,The way that you have to set individual permissions is cumbersome.,1
28,They use to have other option that allowed bulk assignments but changed it.,0
29,"The pricing model seems complicate at first, but it's mostly due to the lack of info that you can get directly from Jira sales reps, at least that was my case, and it made me go to another product, Samanage, for Service Desk.",0
30,"What I don't like about the licensing model is that everything is managed by Jira, so if you buy a plugin in the marketplace, you always tie the licenses to the Jira licenses.",0
31,"e.g. Tempo Planner is a plugin to do, among other things, capacity planning.",0
32,"You won't expect to have too many people there doing the planning, at least not as much as your Jira license base.",0
33,You end up paying for every Jira LIcense you have.,0
34,"So if you have 2 planners and 100 developers, you end up paying for 102 licenses for the plugin.",0
35,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0

70,What do you dislike?,0
71,"It's not free, and if you are dealing with a project that already lives on GitHub, you may as well just use the built in bug tracking system there.",0

78,What benefits have you realized?,0
79,The best use case for JIRA is to expose an issue tracking system to 3rd party developers.,0

140,We all know how finding something in a year goes in your inbox - painful.,0
141,Finding something in Jira is simple - and that is one of the things I love the most - discoverability of the information.,0
142,What do you dislike?,0
143,"This might seem odd, but Jira might almost be too configurable.",0
144,"Crazy, I know.",0
145,"The trick is nailing down the workflow that you use - that is the custom steps you use such as open, in progress, in review, testing, user acceptance.",0
146,"It might take a while for your team to figure out your workflow, but that's just part of the learning process.",0
147,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
148,Confluence will give trial licenses and let you test their products.,0
149,Take advantage of this and give Jira a spin.,0
150,What business problems are you solving?,0
151,What benefits have you realized?,0
152,"Like I mentioned earlier, we are learning to use Jira to track project issues, tasks, and bugs in Jira instead of in emails.",0
153,This has already come in handy in less than a year with needing to go back and quickly search for something that you know you ran into in another project.,0
154,"We typically try to get all of the major tasks for a project into a Jira project before we start work, track all of our tasks during work, then track issues during testing, client acceptance, and knowledge transfer, all the way up to project closure.",0

158,It helps us shift tasks around to make sure everyone's workload is manageable.,0
159,What do you dislike?,0
160,Jira has almost too many features.. it takes a while to get started and figure out how to use it.,0
161,It's possible we don't have it configured properly to match our development process so this may be a human error sort of thing but an intuitive tool shouldn't take an expert to set up and figure out.,1
162,"It is very focused on agile development, which is great for development teams but for our company we have to use a different project management software for the other teams (marketing, sales etc...).",1
163,I haven't found a suitable integration into our other tool which makes it a bit hard to jump between the two.,1
164,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
165,"Jira is a very robust tool and has lots of features and integrations, however, it's not very easy to set up and requires someone with expertise to get the team up and running.",1

168,We use Jira to plan our development sprints.,0
169,We track tasks and bugs in Jira and it gives us good visibility over the development team.,0
170,What do you like best?,0
171,I like JIRA Agile a lot because it give you modern tools for project management.,0
172,Also like OnDemand solution because it provides full experience with hot fixes and patches deployed right when available and you shouldn't have DevOps engineer to apply all these patches.,0
173,I found that atlassian try to adjust UI every month and always introduce small but very useful features to their product.,0
174,LIRA is always evaluating and provides latest experience from Agile community.,0
175,What do you dislike?,0

177,Writing your own plugin isn't as easy as it can be.,1
178,Also installing them on OnDemand version a kind of tricky.,1
179,Atlasssian provides entire library with many of add-ons but it's hard to find real great which you will use every day.,0
180,Except probably for Tempo - this one I can recommend.,0
181,Add-ons become outdated pretty fast because they supported but third parties and Atlasssian updates Jira version a lot.,0
182,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
183,I know that a lot of people hate it because find JIRA a kind of complex and that's true.,0
184,But if you have big team and/or custom workflow - Jira can help you make solid process and workflow.,0

198,* Ability to tag others in comments.,0
199,What do you dislike?,0
200,"The major issue I have with JIRA is a common one across this whole eco-system, which is the inability to share tickets across more than one assignee.",1
201,"While this is a contentious workflow, since some people feel that there is no way for people to work on the EXACT same issue, I personally see a value in being able to assign a ticket to multiple people.",0
202,"At the very least, ""epic"" style issues should be able to be assigned to multiple people.",1
203,"For JIRA specific issues, I am not satisified with their small-screen design.",0

209,"Overall, using JIRA helps us to be able to know who is working on what, how much effort is required, and what is top priority across teams.",0
210,We have noticed an increase in productivity and cross-team knowledge transfer from integrating JIRA in all our workflows.,0
211,What do you like best?,0
212,"Something I really like on Jira is the flexibility it provides, becoming very helpful for whom work with multiple types and sizes of projects.",0
213,"You can customize screens, fields, workflows, share configurations between projects, import issues from Github, smart commits, and the killer one (according to my needs): Boards with multiple projects.",0
214,"I can have a board for each project, or a board with multiple projects, making easier to plan my week since I have to switch between different projects daily.",0
215,Another great feature (the best one among other PM services I have tried before) is its powerful search.,0
216,You can create very complex queries in a kind of SQL syntax if you want.,0
217,Which allows to apply bulk actions in the result of the search.,0
218,What do you dislike?,0
219,"In the cloud version, it can become a little bit slow sometimes, and you can't select more than one item in the search result.",1
220,"You still can run bulk operations for all the returned items, but can't select a few... just one.",1
221,Do not provide a mobile app.,1

232,"A well-rounded tracking tool for project planning, estimation, generating epics, stories, assigning tickets, and real-time collaboration on issues such as image uploads and commenting.",0
233,What do you dislike?,0
234,The user interface could be better.,0
235,Overall design leaves a lot to be desired.,0
236,Recently updated with some user experience improvements but it still requires a bit of a learning curve to get fully up to speed on all features and functionalities.,0

245,What do you dislike?,0

247,"The interface is a mere juxtaposition of features, it is completely filled with buttons and options you don't need all the time thus being extremely hard to find the ones you do want.",1
248,"The whole systems looks like a legacy one, the UI is rather old resulting in an awful UX with clunky processes and several steps to perform simple actions.",0
249,"Also, it has a huge learning and configuration curve, it takes a long time to understand/administrate the system and chances are that users end up experiencing traumatic heisenbugs.",1
250,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0

258,"While there was a steep onramp to using the ALM suite overall, I found that after some moderate training and consistent use, I was quickly able to become comfortable with ALM overall and specifically, JIRA.",0
259,"JIRA is leaps and bounds above the tool I used as its predecessor, which was the archaic and often painful ClearQuest.",0
260,I still use that tool for some legacy work but vastly prefer JIRA now that I have learned the basics within it.,0
261,"JIRA offers so many specific, detailed features that even after 2 years of use, I feel I have only scratched the surface of how it can be utilized.",0
262,What do you dislike?,0
263,There was an incredibly steep learning curve for ALM overall but specifically for JIRA.,0
264,"Even with a relatively longterm background with simple code and commands, many users (including myself) found it hard to intuitively navigate through the multitude of options available.",1
265,"This is both a benefit and a cost of JIRA, in that it offers so many features and options.",0
266,"Once you become well versed and comfortable navigating through the options you use most often, all of these additional features become extremely valuable.",0
267,"One huge downside that I have realized is that when you work on a large scale program, the ALM Messaging alerts become annoying and then irrelevant.",1
268,"Many users have so many messages on a daily basis that they have completely stopped using this feature, which is very unfortunate, because if these problems were addressed, it would be very valuable.",1
269,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
270,Take your time learning how to use the tool.,0
271,"Adopting an experienced mentor who is already using the tool, and in the ways you will use it, is probably mandatory.",0
272,"Even with detailed training, both CBT and ILT, most users needed a lot of additional assistance to become comfortable with the tool and all the options.",0
273,"However, once comfortable, it is incredibly valuable.",0
274,What business problems are you solving?,0
275,What benefits have you realized?,0
276,"As mentioned above, I have mostly transitioned from ClearQuest to JIRA, aside from some legacy tracking.",0
277,"While there was a steep rampup, not only to use the tool but to set up all the correct data initially, the value that JIRA adds over its predecessor is incredible.",0
278,"The ability for JIRA to interact with the other ALM features, in addition to email/tagging/etc is extremely valuable.",0
279,"In addition, the ALM messaging system is an easier way to alert users of references and action items.",0
280,"We are also able to use options such as burndown charts, staffing projections, and project management with expanded features that were never even a consideration with the predecessor tools.",0
281,The ability to create dashboards with a vast variety of widgets is also an area I continue to learn and it has become increasingly valuable as I learn these details.,0
282,What do you like best?,0
283,The team in which I work had played around with the idea of using Agile Jira for a bit but I was the first one to really go ahead and implement it in a useful way.,0
284,What do you dislike?,0
285,"If you're not using an agile work flow, this is probably not the best solution, as you can imagine from the name.",1
286,There's also a tendency to spend a lot of time documenting and putting information into Jira instead of actually doing the work so the user needs to be consciously making sure not to go ovverboard with the Jira usage.,0
287,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
288,"Best used in conjunction with other Atlassian products, this really works best if you use Agile Jira with Confluence for example.",0

290,What business problems are you solving?,0
291,What benefits have you realized?,0
292,"I deal with production support and needed a good way to tag people for help, to track the progress etc.",0

295,We use hosted cloud version of JIRA so set up was painless.,0
296,It's quick and easy to get projects set up and you can use the features to the level that suits you.,0
297,For some projects it's just a easier and more convenient way of keeping track of tasks than email.,0
298,"For larger projects the ability to set schedules, assignees, priorities etc gives a far greater level of control.",0
299,"JIRA Capture is fantastic as it allows the design team to take and annotate screenshots of bugs or changes, or the dev team record issues with the websites we work on.",0
300,What do you dislike?,0
301,Occasionally it can run a little slowly in the browser.,1
302,I'd love to be able to have template projects that automatically add tasks that are common to all projects.,1

319,Look and feel comes to mind.,0
320,I spent a lot of my time working on JIRA and I wish I could make it more lively.,0
321,I think a feature that I would like to addressed is the issue of duplication.,1

323,"I wish there was a feature of auto-fill facility , something which we have in Stackoverflow or Jira Query writer.",1
324,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
325,It is said that initial installation of JIRA is time-consuming and cumbersome.,1
326,"However, past that point, JIRA will prove all the efforts worth the experience.",0
327,"In a large establishment where project management has a different meaning as per the responsibilities and nature of the job, JIRA proves to be efficient and accomplishes work for employees at each level, from CXO to the developer.",0
328,What business problems are you solving?,0
329,What benefits have you realized?,0
330,I was working as a developer for a fin-tech company.,0
331,"Before JIRA, there was a very complex tool being used for team and project management.",0
332,JIRA proved to be a very convenient transformation from that tool and made project-tracking and hence accountability much easier.,0
333,The teams were much more motivated to account for time spent on tasks as it became easier to do and they could visualize whole team's effort through burn down charts for the sprint.,0
334,What do you like best?,0
335,JIRA is an easy to use task management system.,0
336,It is perfect for the agile approach to software engineering and allows for quick management of large projects.,0
337,For the average user it is a great place to compile all the tasks and split them up per person and and per sprint or category.,0
338,"The UI is also easy to use, but thoroughly extensive when it comes to options available.",0
339,What do you dislike?,0
340,JIRA can be a little difficult to get the hang of at first and does require constant attention when developing a large project.,0
341,Adding more people and more filters can be cumbersome at times and a few of the UI screens can get messy real quick depending on what you have displayed.,1
342,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
343,I recommend using JIRA for large project management in a professional setting.,0
344,It is easy to use and setup and will save you a lot of hassle in the end.,0
345,What business problems are you solving?,0
346,What benefits have you realized?,0
347,JIRA allows us to maintain and organize a large mobile game project in one space.,0
348,It is great for keep track of tasks over a large period of time and ultimately helps us develop software even faster than before.,0
349,What do you like best?,0
350,Jira enables you to see what is going on for an entire sprint for every member of the team.,0
351,"You know the status (ready, in progress, in review, acceptance, done) of any project at any given time, for any team member.",0
352,"It helps you ""Flag"" where there are holdups, so delays (usually on the client end) don't cause real hold ups in workflow.",0
353,What do you dislike?,0
354,It can be glitchy and it takes a lot of work to set up initially.,1
355,We had a consultant help us which was very valuable.,0
356,Each monthly release planning is also very time consuming for the Product owner.,0
357,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0

359,What business problems are you solving?,0
360,What benefits have you realized?,0
361,Increased productivity and efficiency.,0
362,"We are no longer held up if there are issues, and things get taken off of your mental and tangible ""to do"" once it's an impediment.",0
363,We also have a stronger handle on our team's capacity and know when it's close to being at max.,0
364,What do you like best?,0
365,Easy way to combine bug tracking with requirement management.,0
366,I started using JIRA 5 years ago only for issue tracking and linked it to my QMetry Test Management software.,0
367,"Back then they had an agile plugin called ""Greenhopper"" which was nice, but not yet fully integrated.",0
368,"A few years back Atlassian bought Greenhopper and rebranded it as ""JIRA Agile"" and we started using it for product planning.",0
369,What I really liked about this was my ability as a product manager to see what was in development and to track the progress of both development and QA.,0
370,Since a lot of people use JIRA for competing purposes it is important to have tight control on permissions.,0
371,JIRA provides that.,0
372,"To be honest 5 years ago the Admin was very confusing, but it has gotten much better as the years have progressed.",0
373,What is clear is that the control is very good.,0
374,We have over 50 separate projects now with over 500 users.,0
375,"Some projects require strict security, others are shared between... What do you dislike?",0
376,The Agile board often crashes.,1
377,"This is caused due to a fairly large backlog, but a backlog I feel is well within reason based on my experience.",0
378,Custom fields have been a source of pain.,1
379,Fields are shared between projects and with a seemingly unlimited number of UDFs we have a lot.,0
380,It is not uncommon for a new field to crop up in an existing project.,1
381,Sometimes it is even mandatory!,0
382,"I think this is largely just bad administration, but having done a bit of admin for the tool myself I can say it was not always intuitive.",1
383,Thankfully I feel it is getting better.,0
384,Emails- way too many!,1
385,"You can turn off emails, but I don't want to do that.",0
386,I want emails I just don't want too many.,1
387,JIRA made it so that developers could quickly make updates for each field rather than opening an edit window.,0
388,"Sounds good, right?",0
389,In practice it sucks.,0
390,Many days I get over 100 emails relating to just a handful of issues.,0
391,Worse Outlook doesn't group the emails!,0
392,Sifting through the emails to... Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
393,If you are not sure if JIRA is right for you then spend $10 to get a 10 license copy.,0
394,Use that with one project and see how it goes.,0
395,What business problems are you solving?,0
396,What benefits have you realized?,0
397,In the past I often had to write Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) which were usually outdated as soon as they were printed.,0
398,"What made matters worse is the engineering often didn't reference the PRD once development started, and a few times QA never even saw the original doc.",0
399,They would pass or fail features without really knowing the user story.,0
400,"And if they failed something engineering often said it was ""as designed"".",0
401,Without anything to disagree with that statement the feature would often be passed and I would end up catching it late in the process- sometimes too late.,0
402,We moved our requirements to JIRA 5 years ago and eliminated the above problem.,0
403,The comments in JIRA keep communication clear between all groups.,0
404,Comments can be in rich text and can included pictures and mockups.,0
405,A couple of years ago development fully embraced Agile using the JIRA Agile add on.,0
406,This improved communication in development and kept us on...,0
407,What do you like best?,0
408,The almost real time updates and change logs are very helpful when multiple people are working on the same project.,0
409,The linking between different items is helpful (see note in dislikes) to get a better sense of the bigger picture.,0
410,What do you dislike?,0
411,Can be difficult to navigate between multiple linked bugs/stories without losing track of where you started and opening multiple browser tabs.,1
412,"When creating a new item, it can be easily lost if you don't navigate to it right away.",1
413,"May be based on organizational setup, but there fields that should allow a user entry if one of the drop down options does not apply.",1
414,Searching can be difficult without specific training on how to use the tool.,1

424,"Jira is THE tool to manage team is an AGILE methodology, and give a lot of information about the current task, planning, status, but also help me to follow the tasks still to be done later, the dependency and many other planning task.",0
425,"The TEMPO usage is also very useful to track the time spent, especially to verify the time estimated and really spent, with an easy team time tracking.",0
426,"The Zephyr plugin can be used to link the Jira ""Bug Tracker"" to a real ""Test tool"" which made the interdependence between bug and test, with their reproducible scenario.",0
427,What do you dislike?,0
428,"The licence management is a bit difficult, as all plugin licence are based on the total number of users, so you haven't the possibility to test a component by few people, or to restrict the usage to some people (by example, Zephyr plugin is for test, and used only by test team, but I need to pay for all the R&D resources).",0
429,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
430,"Be able to ""test"" package, for few users, to validate the interest in some plugin.",0
431,"Be able to have, by default, more ""graph"" to do board tools (we are using EasyBi to do them).",0
432,What business problems are you solving?,0
433,What benefits have you realized?,0
434,"The task following of the team, in an Agile methodoligy is always difficult to follow on a day to day basis.",0
435,"With Jira, and some plugin like EasyBi, Zephyr or Tempo, we have all the tools to monitor the R&D center and take the good decision every day.",0
436,What do you like best?,0
437,"JIRA has great organizational features of the data you save - like your stories, filtering by tags, etc.",0
438,"You can show stories as blocked by other issues, integrate Zendesk tickets - that's great.",0
439,That's what we need.,0
440,What do you dislike?,0
441,"The overview page uses up wayyyyy too much space listed stories, and when you click on a story for an overview it uses a small vertical sliver to display the story.",1
442,The story is the most important thing.,0
443,So much screen space is used to show small story titles when it would be better to have more space for the expanded description and overview.,1
444,"Trying to use it to begin with was an onboarding nightmare, and I was incredibly frustrated with it.",0
445,"After about 3 months I'm finally 'meh' with it and can kind of use it, but it still frustrates me.",0
446,"Having each link open within the app is probably the most frustrating, god-awful thing about JIRA.",1
447,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
448,After 3 months you might feel okay with it.,0
449,What business problems are you solving?,0
450,What benefits have you realized?,0
451,Organization of stories and Zendesk help integration.,0
452,"I think Pivotal has a better system for what we need, honestly, and it's presented in a clearer format.",0
453,"This just feels big and bulky, extremely overengineered for what you're trying to do - simply looking at the description of any issue and working on it quickly.",0
454,There are good organizational benefits to it.,0
455,That solves my issues.,0
456,What do you like best?,0
457,It is a very good documentation tool for issues tracking and project management.,0
458,"Users can go down to every detail such as the editing history, votes, multiple status, anything you can think of.",0
459,The ownership and the role and responsibility of a task is very clear.,0
460,"Also, the ticking system is great, which will notify assignees through email.",0
461,What do you dislike?,0
462,Too much information.,0
463,Sometimes it is a bit overwhelming when being ticketed by the product manager.,1
464,A bug ticket will have a reporter and watchers potentially get notified when you put any comments - even changing the typo of the comments.,0
465,"You will see red priority indicators and a blocker sign with ""unresolved"" tag plus the red bars - of course an unresolved bug is a blocker and is the priority to fix by the dev team.",0
466,"Even worse, you see all your faces appear next to the bugs.",0

485,"The price for small teams is low, just $10 a month for up to 10 users.",0

511,What benefits have you realized?,0
512,"We maintain our engineering bug-tracking, and task/project planning on JIRA.",0
513,"It's been convenient to use JIRA to track each task through the workflow, but it seems to be more heavy-weight than needed, with a difficult-to-use UI.",0
514,"However, JIRA has powerful reporting tools which help us easily gather stats about the health of the team.",0
515,"The last benefit we realized is being able to easily integrate JIRA with our existing tools (automated testing/bug-reporting, wiki (Confluence), etc).",0

517,I love how everything that I need to know about our current and upcoming releases is communicated to me in one simple hub.,0

566,I worked with JIRA on one of our projects and I think it is a nice tool for agile project management.,0

574,Here are a few of my favorites:.,0
575,- Notifications: Automatic email notifications on issue activity (highly configurable).,0
576,"You don't have to visit JIRA in your web browser to be notified of important events; they come into your inbox, which then links to the item of interest.",0
577,#NAME?,0
578,Search over multiple projects and fields and even attached files.,0
579,Basic search builder lets you assemble searches by combing options from various drop-down menus and controls (very nice); switch to advanced and you can then see the search expressed in a powerful query language.,0
580,"- Reporting: It's easy to build issue reports based on a variety of factors (components, labels, assignee, issue type, etc, etc.).",0
581,The reports can also be exported to a variety of formats such as Word and Excel.,0
582,#NAME?,0
583,"While JIRA is great for task assignment and tracking in the context of Project Management, it doesn't allow you to work with tasks like you would a tool like Microsoft Project.",1
584,You can schedule issues.,0
585,"You can setup linkages and dependencies, but because you can't view these things in a linear timeline or gantt chart, it's not great for the actual planning exercise.",1
586,"As a consequence, I often find myself manually wrestling to keep tasks in my MS Project plan in sync with issues in JIRA.",0
587,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
588,"With a little creativity, JIRA can be much more than just an issue tracker.",0
589,"Since you can customize forms and fields and issue types, you can really turn it into a sort of database.",0

608,The notification system by mail is ok.,0
609,What do you dislike?,0
610,It seems to me... clunky and kinda dated.,0
611,I seems to me that some amateur company could easily replicate the style and all.,0
612,Also it's kinda confusing.,0
613,And there some blank space in some pages that seems to be lacking of content (In Example: the dashboard; on the left there's almost nothing).,0
614,Last but not least I would improve the performance of the page.,1
615,Sometimes it takes too long to load or while it's loading the page you can see that it's activating some JS things like selects.,1
616,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
617,"Yes, I would definitely recommend JIRA to another user or startup who need to do project management and issue tracking.",0
618,Because it's good and useful.,0
619,I think there's a lot a things to improve.,0

631,Our biggest struggle with JIRA is that we continually run into buggy behavior.,0
632,"Often, we will not be able to access JIRA for a long period of time; it simply goes down, and there's nothing we can do.",0
633,We are dead in the water until it is back up and running.,0
634,"Also, it isn't the easiest thing to manage.",0
635,Not just any user can customize things within JIRA to meet their needs.,1

638,"Training, training, and more training.",0
639,This is not a product that just anyone can use intuitively upon opening.,0

675,JIRA has not been an effective tool to engage user experience (UX) in the dev process.,1
676,"As a lead in building out consumer facing web products, it's critical that UX and engineering have a way to interact.",0
677,"Today, our UX team uses Invision to create mocks and prototypes, which need to tie back into the JIRA for dev team to reference.",0
678,"However, there is a disconnect with integrating these processes and as a result, either I (or UX) need to copy+paste screenshots into JIRA, or link back to the Invision project (outside of JIRA).",1
679,"Ideally, JIRA would help in this type of collaboration.",0
680,"It's possible they have a solution, but it's not obvious to me.",0
681,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
682,I belive JIRA can address numerous use cases.,0
683,I encourage you to get familiar with the tool and work with your broader team to organize your instance in a way that makes sense and maps to your engineering organization.,0
684,What business problems are you solving?,0
685,What benefits have you realized?,0
686,"In my role, I'm focused on building out features that allow us to scale in the enterprise and features aimed at optimizing key Marketo workflows.",0
687,My work spans across the platform and application side of the house.,0
688,This means I'm collaborating with a different set of actors and JIRA plays a critical role in my ability to manage multiple unrelated-projects with different groups of engineers.,0
689,What do you like best?,0
690,Great UI and easy to use for simple users.,0
691,They give 2 options for setup which includes cloud hosted and self-hosted so it gives us great portability and control for our users.,0
692,What do you dislike?,0
693,Can be confusing for more of its advanced features like setting up tasks for multiple people or for things ahead of time.,1
694,Also moving things from backlog to in progress has changed to a less intuitive way.,1
695,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
696,Great for small to medium companies trying to estimate the work that has to be done.,0
697,What business problems are you solving?,0
698,What benefits have you realized?,0

700,"By having a centralized area to see work, we can see who is working on what and how quickly they are working so we can accurately give estimates for our customers.",0
701,What do you like best?,0
702,Atlassian JIRA has very powerful permission settings so that we can create workgroups with particular access levels to control who saw what information and what they could do with it.,0
703,"JIRA is a highly customizable tool, almost anything can be adjusted, with a wide selection of pre-installed tools or downloadable add ons, to satisfy various requirements for metrics and charts expected by stakeholders.",0
704,Configurable workflow allows us to have separate life cycles for each project.,0
705,What do you dislike?,0
706,"While configurable, JIRA requires a certain amount of effort to extend its data schema with new attributes.",1
707,JIRA still lacks some important ways of data visualization.,1
708,"Sometimes it's hard to represent all data points of the lifecycle in the same instance of JIRA, especially when it needs to be done ""yesterday"" or ""abruptly"".",1
709,"So we have to use Labels, Components, Fix Versions etc, as anything but what it says just to put everything into the required model of implementation.",0
710,It's not very user-friendly.,0
711,It took me a few months to start feeling comfortable with the administration settings.,0
712,What business problems are you solving?,0
713,What benefits have you realized?,0
714,In a very large organization that has a lot of different types of work and different workflows with a lot of separation of responsibility Atlasssian JIRA is a must have tool and it might be required for task management and bug tracking.,0
715,What do you like best?,0
716,"One of my favorite parts about JIRA is how open source it is, we can always change something if we don't like it, add something we need, or remove things.",0
717,"My most favorite part about JIRA though is the All Digital Epics board, where you can create your own columns and drag and drop projects so Everyone in the company can see what stage we are at with all projects on one board!",0
718,"We had this in physical form but that meant getting up from our desks to go move things around haha once we upgraded to JIRA, we never looked back.",0
719,What do you dislike?,0
720,"The only thing that bugs me sometimes are all the bugs in JIRA, pun not intended haha.",0
721,"It's not very responsive, impossible to use on my phone, but that is not a dealbreaker at all!",1
722,Just means I can't work when on the run which is actually ok haha.,0

725,What business problems are you solving?,0
726,What benefits have you realized?,0
727,"The problems that we were solving in our company is communication, it was hard for all the developers, designers, producers, QA and other teams to all be on the same page.",0
728,JIRA has majorly helped this and benefited our company in so many ways.,0
729,"We can now all see at once what stage each of our projects is at, and easily communicate with eachother via comments/bugs/tasks.",0
730,What do you like best?,0
731,The ability to define my own dashboards that contain the information that is most relevant to my job.,0
732,I also like the Agile plug-in which provides the ability to use SCRUM or Kanban to manage software development projects.,0
733,What do you dislike?,0
734,Sometimes the workflow management for issues becomes cumbersome.,1
735,"It would be nice to have a ""Close"" option available at every state instead of having to pre-define all the states to be able to transition to the ""Closed"" state.",1
736,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
737,JIRA works well as a project management and bug tracking system.,0
738,It is tightly integrated with other Atlasssian product such as Confluence and BitBucket but provides enough features to be used as a standalone tool.,0
739,Atlasssian also provides an API which allows additional integration with other software development tools.,0
740,What business problems are you solving?,0
741,What benefits have you realized?,0

744,It makes the work of our team easier and much more structured.,0
745,"It can be hosted on our own server, so safety regulations can easily be met.",0
746,"It's pretty flexible, offers a lot of plugins but most functions that the typical user needs are implemented anyways.",0
747,What do you dislike?,0
748,"Sometimes it seems like the whole community asks for a feature or bugfix, but other stuff gets implemented first.",0
749,"Even major updates sometimes just get rid of nice functionalities from the last version, without any info on this.",1
750,"This is pretty rare and hasn't happened in an important setting for us, though.",0
751,"The price policy is understandable, but oftentimes I would wish it would be different (not every user needs _all_ the functions, but has to pay for it...).",0
752,What business problems are you solving?,0
753,What benefits have you realized?,0
754,The project management and allocation of tasks.,0
755,The kanban boards really help to see important stuff at a glance.,0
756,What do you like best?,0
757,There are several things that makes Jira stand out.,0
758,"First of all it allows us to centrally manage everything: tasks, issues, bugs, stories and so on.",0
759,Secondly it integrates very nicely with other tools from BitBucket as well as other vendors.,0
760,There is large community around it and a wide variety of plugins are available.,0
761,What do you dislike?,0

763,I think it will be fair if I say it isn't beautiful and looks like something from previous decade.,0
764,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
765,The most important recommendation probably is to plan in advance how you are going to use Jira and configure it accordingly.,0

772,Jira meets all our basic needs for Kanban and Scrum agile styles.,0
773,Issue tracking is good and backlog grooming is easy.,0
774,Burndown and velocity charts are nice.,0
775,What do you dislike?,0
776,"Jira is just FINE, I don't think it's anything spectacular or innovative in this space.",0
777,Admin permissions and rights are a pain.,1
778,We need more refined ways for users to see where their projects are in our backlog without having the ability to see everything in the backlog.,1
779,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
780,"Be cautious about deciding who will admin your account - if your teams grow and you branch out into additional teams and boards, admin can get messy.",0
781,What business problems are you solving?,0
782,What benefits have you realized?,0
783,"We needed a tool to manage our backlog and agile boards, and Jira meets those needs, but as we have more teams adopt agile our Jira account and permissions get more and more cumbersome to navigate.",1
784,What do you like best?,0
785,Very easy but function-rich platform for managing agile projects.,0
786,"Using Greenhopper plug-in, very easy to make epics and user stories and maintain a full backlog from sprint to sprint.",0
787,"Easy to take user stories with the development and QA teams from the backlog, create subtasks and track hours of effort towards them in order to assess sprint progress and overall release status.",0
788,What do you dislike?,0
789,"Performance was not the best, especially when the backlog was large and there were lots of projects loaded into our instance.",1
790,We even had to figure out ways to get around having to refresh the backlog page during story elaboration sessions as it was taking so long in some cases.,1
791,Also used it for time reporting and it wasn't that straightforward.,1
792,Entering time shouldn't be as complicated as they make it and changing things you have already entered is not intuitive at all (borderline frustrating in fact).,1
793,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
794,"If you are just getting started as an agile shop, JIRA with the Greenhopper plug-in provides all that you will need for development, QA and product management.",0
795,"It is easy to set up, a bit complicated on the administration but a bit troublesome on the performance side if you really start to create scores of projects on it with large backlogs throughout.",1

803,I think JIRA is really organized and easy to use.,0
804,"I've never used anything else on the market, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it gets the job done and helps communicate the project to the entire company.",0
805,What do you dislike?,0
806,I can NEVER find anything I'm searching for.,1
807,Sometimes if I'm lucky there are key words I remember.,0
808,"I try to search by tickets that I've originated, but that never yields anything.",1
809,"Or I search by the person who it's been assigned to, but that doesn't work either.",1
810,I wish there more real-time updating because colleagues are always editing my tickets and we're always tripping over each other and losing what we've typed.,1
811,"Some of the navigation is a little clunky like when you have that preview mode to see a list of your tickets and then a column to the right that has more information about the ticket, but I kind of wish that when you clicked the ticket number, it opened in a new tab so you could still reference your list of tickets.",1
812,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0

814,What business problems are you solving?,0
815,What benefits have you realized?,0
816,I use JIRA for product development since I'm a product manager.,0

828,"I have been working in multiple projects in my organization, sometime I find it difficult to switch between sprints or stories of different project.",1
829,Basically I found it difficult to search if I do not have a story id.,1
830,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
831,"Yes I do recommend others to use this tool as it improves the understanding between the business and the software development team, in order to provide an efficient solution.",0
832,"In case you are tired of manually maintaining your requirements, updates to it, application solution implemented for it, here is a cool tool which helps to do all that for you.",0
833,"Being a developer one more reason I why would recommend this tool is because it has a great connectivity with other code development tool like Subversion (for code repository), Fisheye (Code reviews), Confluence (maintaining live documentation for design and architecture).",0

842,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
843,"There are lot of tools around, the advantage is that JIRA have been in the market for somehow and some devs and even other kind of people already know it, but if you are looking for something new and more agile with a better UX, I would definely try something else, maybe taiga.",0
844,What business problems are you solving?,0

847,What do you like best?,0
848,I love many things about JIRA!,0
849,"Mostly the ability to quickly and easily leave notes and attachments, assign the case to someone other than yourself, and to adjust the priority on cases.",0
850,You can set priorities as well as degree of importance.,0
851,For example: Critical & Hot Fix requested.,0
852,I love how you can create 'Epic' JIRA cases so that a main case contains links to several other cases that relate to one another.,0
853,What do you dislike?,0
854,Sometimes it is hard to use the search feature to find a case that you are looking for particularly if you have many cases that contain the same key words.,1
855,"Searching by Project makes things easier but even still, sometimes the project is unknown as well.",0
856,Additional search features would be nice!,1

1052,We switched to JIRA + JIRA Agile (now rebranded as JIRA Software) in an attempt to clean up this mess and scale our process as we grew.,0
1053,"While JIRA definitely has a learning curve, and is yet to be come _really_ friendly for non-development teams, it addressed all the pain points mentioned above.",0
1054,"That said, it is a larger and bulkier product that comes with some trade-offs, but it brings more value than the effort it takes to maintain itself as a tool.",0

1056,I like that it is mobile friendly and somewhat responsive on my screens.,0
1057,We have JIRA and Confluence together and are able to manage our documentation a lot easier versus our previous set up.,0

1059,It was a REALLY HUGE deal-maker.,0
1060,Additionally we wanted to call out various pieces of the project that would require labeling or categorization.,0
1061,We use the components feature for that.,0
1062,What do you dislike?,0
1063,The product isn't as responsive in a web browser as I would like.,1
1064,It would also be nice to tie various project areas together for version control as a lot of the stuff is pushed out in one go.,1

1314,What do you dislike?,0
1315,My main complaint with the Jira is it hides some of the common functionality thats required deep down in the UI.,1
1316,Other complaint is their REST API: when I was looking to integrate JIRA with a chat bot on SLACK.,1
1317,I found their API to be very complicated.,1

1344,Too much functionality leads to bad UX.,0
1345,"Sometimes it takes too much time to find things, especially when the person who does that is not IT specialist.",1

1715,Required quire a bit of back and forth with our support team and the JIRA product team to work out kinks and improve the user experience.Would encourage all first time users to assign power users to the software who can learn from the JIRA team and will be able to assist their respective teams.,0

1750,Jira can occasionally be very cumbersome.,0
1751,"Some of that difficulty can come from making this more complicated than they need to be via customization, but there are a handful of situations where you will be looking for the ability to customize a behavior and be stopped cold in your tracks.",1

1753,We find ourselves in a situation where it's very time consuming to backup our instance and clone it for upgrade testing.,1

2045,"There are numerous players in the ticketing scheme, and many can be less expensive than Jira is.",0

2350,"It's also very stark and business-like, maybe it could be more fun to use.",0
2351,"It's also unstructured in some ways; it tries to get people to be ""agile"" but sometimes just reinforces old bad habits.",0

2363,As integrator and consultants the low baseline price tag allows to introduce it easily to customers and then allow them to test drive the real product.,0
2364,What do you dislike?,0
2365,The handling of tasks and sub-tasks is very poor.,1
2366,From such a product you'd expect at leas some sort of WBS support.,0

2374,What I like best about Jira is that if in the middle of a project there is an update I can easily communicate that to our third party vendor without taking up too much time.,0
2375,For instance after we submit for an email blast to be created our design team came back and wanted something changed last minute.,0
2376,"All I had to do was go into Jira, remove the old graphic upload the new updated version and make the comment in the comments section.",0
2377,Its a lot easier than trying to call the person and deal with the chit chat before getting down to business.,0
2378,And all its easier than email because when you send the email you're not entirely sure when they will see the email.,0
2379,Whereas with Jira you know they are in there working on your request already so they will see it a lot quicker.,0
2380,What do you dislike?,0
2381,I'm not sure what the cause of the issue is but in the past I have had issues with the functionality of the JIRA.,0
2382,For instance I would go to make a email blast request in JIRA and I would click on the create button and it would open the dialogue box where I fill in all the fields for my request.,0
2383,I would reach out to our point of contact and they would say I have to right click the create button if I was having trouble.,0
2384,It would normally work but not all the time.,0
2385,If I had to right click the create button the system just seemed to run slower if that was the case.,1
2386,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
2387,My recommendation to other considering JIRA would be to make sure you discuss with your team before hand what the implementation of JIRA will be and set expectations in terms of interaction.,0
2388,We have issues with people not executing projects properly even though the expectation of the project are drawn out clearly in JIRA.,0
2389,Such as we set a launch date and call it out in two different place on the ticket in JIRA and they still get the launch date wrong.,0
2390,Or we have had issues with people still not using the correct graphic.,0
2391,The issue may start after they download out of JIRA.,0
2392,But you will want to set expectations.,0
2393,What business problems are you solving?,0
2394,What benefits have you realized?,0
2395,I would say JIRA is helping solve Communication and time management.,0
2396,Projects that include several people are very hard to manage.,0
2397,Usually we would experience a lot of bottle necks in our process because people would not see emails and because they wouldn't realize a deadline and let a project fall by the way side.,0
2398,Because Jira can involve everyone at the same time and keep everyone update to with the status of the project we are able to communicate better as well as manage time.,0
2399,For instance if I see that someone is still working on their piece I can start queuing up my part with another coworkers info that has already been provided in Jira instead of having to wait on the middle man.,0
2400,What do you like best?,0
2401,User dashboard with important information.,0
2402,Multiple Projects support.,0
2403,Project activity stream to know what's going on in the project.,0
2404,Kanban and Scrum boards.,0

2407,API's to consume and post data.,0

2446,What do you dislike?,0
2447,time logging is under developed.,1
2448,If you change the status of something to 'done' it does NOT update the remaining hours on a task to 0.,1
2449,Efficient time logging requires the purchase of an add-on.,0
2450,I still don't understand how you handle stories that get moved to new sprints.,1
2451,Somehow--the circumstances I still don't understand--all the incomplete tasks do not move to the new sprint.,1

2484,What business problems are you solving?,0
2485,What benefits have you realized?,0
2486,We use it for our marketing sprints which is unique and not typical for marketing teams but we have a lot of work that we put out that is tangible and requires a lot of help from different teammembers so it's nice having it all in one location.,0
2487,"It also makes it easy to accurately prioritize which tasks are the most valuable to complete first, often something that is not done for marketing teams.",0
2488,What do you like best?,0
2489,The best part about using JIRA is it supports usage of agile boards and kanban.,0

2924,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
2925,This is a very smart way to manage projects and track them and It is very easy to use.,0

3072,"I like that I can see what is being worked on by our development teams, what issues are surfaced and the ability to provide instant context or feedback to keep things moving.",0
3073,What do you dislike?,0
3074,It's not a tool that a business user can easily make sense of.,0
3075,The data isn't really aligned in a way that someone (an exec for example) could get a quick snapshot of what is going on.,1

3081,It is really a good product to collaborate across teams from a case management standpoint.,0
3082,What do you dislike?,0
3083,Would love to see even more collaboration capabilities outside our internal users.,1
3084,"So the ability to manage projects and assign tasks with vendors, customers, etc would be nice.",1
3085,Ability to more easily build roadmaps/higher project plans for planning purposes.,1
3086,What business problems are you solving?,0
3087,What benefits have you realized?,0
3088,Avoid bottleneck by creating queues/functions for internal users to submit requests.,0
3089,Makes it easy for internal users to log those requests without having to know who will do the work.,0
3090,Easy for us to do load balancing and dispatch requests across the teams.,0
3091,Transparency by allowing submitters to see in real time what is the status of their requests as the work is being done.,0
3092,What do you like best?,0
3093,JIRA is the best agile workflow bug-tracking software I've come across.,0
3094,"I've used other products like Track-It, Trello, and BugHerd but JIRA is tops.",0
3095,It loads quickly and gets the job done.,0
3096,What do you dislike?,0
3097,Upgrading your plan is so confusing.,1
3098,The UI for the account management section really needs some work.,1
3099,"Upgrading your plan to pay MORE money should be the easiest path on their site, but it's the hardest to figure out.",1
3100,I also wish you could assign tasks to more than one person if there's a collaboration between multiple people.,1
3101,This would make it easier to sorting too.,1
3102,The issue collector should be fully customizable as well.,1
3103,I wish you could create custom fields and make certain fields required.,1
3104,What business problems are you solving?,0

3111,"With just a few plugins, or the ability to write your own plugins, the possibilities are endless and you can get great benefits from the application.",0
3112,What do you dislike?,0
3113,There are a few inconsistencies in the application and some large gaps in functionality.,0
3114,Examples include: Project Categories have no immediate purpose except to group the projects while viewing the All Projects view as a user only.,1
3115,Another example is the lack of certain functionalities such as linking events so that notifications or other actions can be tied to built in functionality such as linking to another issue.,1
3116,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
3117,"JIRA is headed in the right direction in some aspects of their product, but there are definitely some aspects that are being forgotten about and definitely need attention.",0
3118,They still have many bugs and feature requests which would provide a lot of benefits which are sometimes over 14 years old yet they have no plans to incorporate these into their product.,0
3119,"They also still need to consider their server based users as well, because they have been basing a lot of their product roadmap decisions on their cloud based users, but most large companies are going to be using JIRA on-premise on their own servers, so they may start losing those customers if they ignore their needs.",0
3120,What business problems are you solving?,0
3121,What benefits have you realized?,0
3122,Better time tracking incorporated with issue tracking.,0
3123,Users can be in a single system to both track time and work on issues.,0
3124,Test Case Management is more intuitive and reporting possibilities are endless with the ability to link a test case or a test run to any other issue.,0
3125,We are also improving our SDLC by using Agile methodologies included in the JIRA Agile application.,0
3126,What do you like best?,0
3127,The thing that I like about Jira the most is that it aligns well with Agile software development.,0
3128,"It provides the ability to create tasks at Epic, Story and Sprint levels, and offers several features to manage and track software bugs efficiently.",0
3129,What do you dislike?,0
3130,Jira suffers a bit in comparison to VersionOne and other already well-established project tracking tools because of having limited capability focused on issue tracking and offering little in the way of managing projects overall.,1

3162,What do you dislike?,0
3163,There isn't much I dislike about JIRA.,0
3164,The two minor pain points are that cases open in a right bar when using a sprint board (I'd rather they automatically open in new tabs); and I often have issues pasting in unordered lists -- I formats the line spacing wrong almost every time.,1

3177,Each time I have to go into the story for checking it.,0
3178,"2. Even if the story is closed, the subtasks remain open unless its explicitly closed.",1
3179,3. It would be nicer to have a display on total hours and the total remaining hours of tasks in the sprint.,1
3180,4. Should have a feature to custom clone a story.,1

3223,What do you like best?,0

3239,It integrates with many of the other products and has very few limitations.,0
3240,JIRA works well across any size team and is easy to read and understand.,0
3241,Being able to customize JIRA makes it the perfect tool for any project.,0
3242,Jira can also be combined and integrated with the product suites from Atlassian.,0
3243,Items such as Confluence make JIRA a seamless transition from chart creation to looking up JIRA tickets from the wiki and linking back to them.,0
3244,What do you dislike?,0
3245,JIRA can have a slight learning curve when delving into more advanced features of the product.,0
3246,Some features can often be difficult to find.,1
3247,JIRA also lacks intuitive first uses.,0
3248,"Setting up your projects and dashboard can occasionally be cumbersome, but once learned will be invaluable.",1
3249,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
3250,"If you are considering JIRA, Atlassian has free trials and many additional help tools to get you going.",0
3251,One of the best parts is that there are numerous plug-ins for JIRA to adapt JIRA to what you need.,0
3252,What business problems are you solving?,0
3253,What benefits have you realized?,0
3254,Using JIRA for bug tracking and project management has negated the need for multiple tools.,0

3258,The scope and power of JIRA means it's a truly awesome tool when used correctly.,0
3259,"I use the AGILE add on, which allows me to plan weekly sprints, track issues across teams with swim lanes.",0
3260,It also lets me assign and validate tickets far faster than a mere list view.,0
3261,What do you dislike?,0
3262,"JIRA is very intimidating for new users, and unfortunately it is not always intuitive how you should use it.",0
3263,Because it is so powerful it is difficult for users not familiar with task management systems before (such as Product Managers) to fully understand what is expected of them or how to use it.,0
3264,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
3265,Spend the time thinking about how and why you are using JIRA.,0
3266,It's not something to jump into without thought.,0
3267,However with care and attention it's an amazing product and truly powerful.,0

3281,What do you dislike?,0
3282,The only downside to JIRA that I can think of is scalability.,1

3286,One of the best tools of its kind in the market.,0
3287,"The administration part can be confusing at first, but it is because its flexibility to be customized.",0
3288,"Once you get a hang of it, you won't look back.",0

3293,* general project tracking management.,0
3294,* all purpose task management.,0

3297,"It does have its limitations out of box, but with its add-on framework and API, it is very easy for you to solve the problem with a bit of programming.",0
3298,What do you like best?,0
3299,Jira is mainly helpful for managing products.,0
3300,"Jira basically creates ticket for people who are working in the company for products and whenever a new ticker gets assigned, people(Developers, testers, Managers) will get the mail.",0
3301,"So no need to go to the jira website and check for ticket updates, instead we can redirect using mail only.",0
3302,"Jira's features of categorising the events like 'Prodrugs', 'PMOS', 'Epic'.. helps to understand the task that has been assigned.",0
3303,What do you dislike?,0
3304,I think searching for particular keyword is bit of complicated and results are not so good.,1
3305,I think Jira Api should be given more preferences since manual work will be reduced.,1

3330,"While initially set up to help in SW development, it is easily configured to help with Customer Support requests, HR requests, Facilities work, and anything else you need an effective and flexible issue tracking system for.",0
3331,"For SW Development though, JIRA really shines.",0
3332,"Not only does the initial configuration provide an excellent model for most development teams, but the various hooks JIRA provides makes it the perfect platform to integrate not only into Atlassians other development tools, but any other open development standard such as SVN or git.",0
3333,What do you dislike?,0
3334,While JIRA is a very flexible product.,0
3335,there are still a few hardcoded fields that need to be freed up for it to make it work better in larger implementations.,1
3336,Being able to customize priorities and resolutions per project would make it MUCH more user friendly when moving beyond use within a single group.,1
3337,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
3338,"When considering JIRA, make sure that you know your own internal processes before implementing.",0
3339,"JIRA works best when you know what you want, not when you are designing what you want.",0
3340,What business problems are you solving?,0
3341,What benefits have you realized?,0
3342,"JIRA has helped us not only get a better idea of our technical debt, but also has helped us plan out sane and reasonable releases well ahead of time.",0
3343,"The tools that come with JIRA make it easy to drill into and track longstanding issues, increasing overall product quality.",0
3344,"At the same time the Agile and Portfolio plug-ins make planning and tracking sprints, features, and releases a breeze.",0
3345,What do you like best?,0
3346,With over 500 users currently on our self hosted JIRA server and 250 users on JIRA OnDemand it has become a very popular piece of software for different teams within our division.,0
3347,We get a full featured issue and defect tracker that is integrated through all parts of our development life cycle.,0
3348,"We use it to track everything including requirements, task breakdowns, schedules and defects.",0
3349,It gives us a consistent interface to all the data we need to successfully develop software.,0
3350,Atlassian Support is A+.,0
3351,They are very responsive about all problems and recommendations.,0
3352,I have never opened a ticket that has not been resolved.,0
3353,JIRA Agile is a must for those who are tracking all tasks and having regular scrum meetings and creating sprints.,0
3354,Agile makes this much easier.,0
3355,We have also integrated ALM Works Structure into our server and that works very well for planning and gives you a hierarchical view of all on your tasks and sub tasks.,0
3356,There really is so much that can be said about... What do you dislike?,0
3357,The only downside to JIRA that I can find is even though there are so many different plugins there are cases where certain plugins do not like one another and cause serious problems for the server.,1
3358,There are cases where JIRA upgrades are not possible because some plugins that are important do not work with the version of JIRA you need to upgrade to.,1
3359,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
3360,"I highly recommend JIRA to all companies who have a need for Issue tracking, Product Management, Requirements, etc.",0
3361,We have been very pleased with this product and all other products that we are using from Atlassian.,0
3362,What business problems are you solving?,0
3363,What benefits have you realized?,0
3364,The good thing about Atlassian tools is they talk to one another nicely.,0
3365,We also use Atlassian Confluence and Crucible/FISHEYE.,0
3366,With crucible we can work through the issues while we are talking to our git or subversion repository and submit code reviews before pushing the updates to production.,0
3367,Another example is how we are using Confluence Blueprints with JIRA to track our requirements.,0
3368,This has become very handy and useful for us.,0
3369,We have also figured out a way to integrate JIRA with other tools in our division.,0
3370,By doing this we can work on problems submitted by our customers work on them while keeping close contact and updating our customers with bug fixes and feature requests.,0
3371,What do you like best?,0
3372,Atlassian JIRA is a powerful task management solution for getting work done.,0
3373,The tool started off in software development but can be adapted for virtually any process.,0
3374,JIRA can be highly customized to meet the needs of any team or process.,0
3375,I really enjoy using JIRA.,0
3376,I love the custom fields.,0
3377,"With custom fields I can track any and all information my team wants to track (people, dates, URLs, text etc.).",0
3378,The ability to setup unique projects is also great.,0
3379,"Each project I create can be configured separately with unique fields, statues, workflows, users, security, notifications, and more.",0
3380,This means that all my teams can have the freedom to get their work down how they need to.,0
3381,One size doesn't have to fit all which is great.,0
3382,I also really like the integration with Atlassian Confluence (wiki software tool).,0
3383,Having meeting notes or retrospective summaries that link directly to JIRA issues is great.,0
3384,A linked issue will automatically have its statuses and assignee updated whenever... What do you dislike?,0
3385,"For me, the main weakness of JIRA is administration.",1
3386,Whenever I am customizing JIRA it feels like I am navigating a maze.,1
3387,Because there are so many customizations available it is not always easy to find what I am looking for or how to change it.,1
3388,Another negative is the limited customization available to the default built-in fields.,1
3389,You can't rename the standard fields or do much to change them.,1
3390,"In addition, you can only have a single priority scheme across all projects.",1
3391,"There is no way to change priorities per project, which is annoying when IT teams and business teams are both using the same tool (e.g. a priority of Blocker doesn't make sense to a Marketing team).",1
3392,Lastly Atlassian no longer supports JIRA like it used to.,0
3393,Atlassian lets its community log support and feature requests and then allows the community to vote on which issues are important.,0
3394,However Atlassian doesn't seem to act on the voice of the community.,0
3395,For example the JIRA community has been asking for the... Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
3396,Be prepared to spend some time learning the administrative side of the system if you want to use anything other than the default JIRA experience.,0
3397,"When setting up the system, name everything clearly.",0
3398,You will be thankful you did!,0
3399,Be sure to use JIRA schemes.,0
3400,Schemes are like puzzle pieces that you can reuse everytime you setup a JIRA project.,0
3401,These are very helpful when creating new JIRA projects.,0
3402,Atlassian Answers can be a great resource if you have questions for the community about how to configure things.,0
3403,If you are a development team I highly recommend that you also purchase JIRA agile.,0
3404,This is almost a necessity if you want to setup dashboard views of what work is being accomplished.,0
3405,This also allows you to setup sprints and to estimate in hours or story points.,0
3406,Well worth the money for anyone working towards an agile software environment.,0
3407,In fact we use the same tool for marketing.,0
3408,The dashboard views provided in Agile are excellent.,0
3409,What business problems are you solving?,0
3410,What benefits have you realized?,0
3411,My organization is using JIRA for both IT Development and Marketing.,0
3412,"Each activity is highly customized with its own workflow, statuses, fiends, email notifications, and user groups.",0
3413,And JIRA works well for both actives.,0

7475,When you open your board (project) you can see immediately where your tasks are located - so you see the statuses very quickly.,0
7476,"Another thing that I like is how they handle the little tasks within the Trello cards, each of them has its own discussion thread where we can share documents (briefings usually) and pictures (end results usually).",0
7477,What do you dislike?,0
7478,"The default features set is not very big, you'll need to be Gold member to active some of the important or essential features like adding a picture as background to your boards or adding a calendar with due dates for tasks / projects.",0

7510,Comments with '@ mentions' allow users to alert users on changes as well as keeping conversations within the software so you can track whats going on.,0
7511,What do you dislike?,0
7512,"With it had the potential to incorporate 'weights' to the tasks, or points, so you are able to signify either what's higher priority, or whats going to take more time.",0
7513,"As it stands, it really only lets you list your tasks like sticky notes so you know what to do.",0

7520,It has been a great tool for our sales and marketing team as a way of introducing the agile process and being the focal point of our daily stand-up meetings.,0

7522,What do you dislike?,0
7523,Would like to have the ability to make font style changes in the card view.,1

7597,"So far, Trello doesn't allow me to add people as participants or viewers.",1
7598,"Instead, anyone can create a card or edit a card.",0
7599,That's good and bad.,0
7600,"It's good in that allows the participants to have a sense of ownership but potentially bad if a participant inadvertently changes a card's title, description, order within a day column (which are supposed to be chronological) or creates a new column.",0
7601,The headache comes when e-mail alerts are sent to everyone before I've had a chance to make sure it's ok to send.,1

8141,So awesome for project management.,0

8172,I think Trello could add some features to help users keep their project dashboards clean.,1
8173,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0

8175,But I think that new trello boards work best when the teams are relatively small.,0
8176,What business problems are you solving?,0
8177,What benefits have you realized?,0
8178,It's a great project collaboration tool.,0
8179,It really helps solve the problem of helping other teammates know what you're working on and which initiatives are key to the project's success.,0

8203,"Having all the relevant project task information centralized and visible really helped communication, lost tasks and even managers see where items were in the queue.",0

8205,As long you don't expect Trello to be a full program/project management system and realize that it is a great visual Kanban board system then there aren't really too many cons to the product.,1

8207,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
8208,Give it a quick trial and you'll see how easy it is to use.,0

8211,Read a quick summary of Kanban and visualization principles and you'll appreciate Trello even more.,0
8212,What business problems are you solving?,0
8213,What benefits have you realized?,0
8214,"We needed a centralized, web-based resource to track and communicate about project tasks.",0
8215,Communication moved from email to the comments on the cards and we even realized some versioning benefits by attaching files to the cards so everyone was working from the latest.,0
8216,The system was easy enough to use that execs could drop in and quickly get an idea of how much work was happening and where particular items were in the process without having to ask team members for updates.,0
8217,It even helped structure meetings as the visual layout helped prioritize and scope work in progress.,0
8218,What do you like best?,0
8219,"Accessible from various platform and the ability to share board, and ease to operate with the agile process, and yet it can be very structured with check lists and even media attached to notes.",0

8246,"- If you have some cutting edge startup, you probably should be using it;.",0
8247,"For new startups, Trello can be useful to create a visible and manageable backlog.",0
8248,This can help you to focus on what's is important for that crucial moment.,0
8249,Trello's power up if your team if based on remote workers (some of or all team).,0
8250,"Physical kanban in cases like that is almost impossible, so, Trello becomes a great option.",0
8251,"You can create colorful tickets and labels to split tasks by 'team' or 'type', which turns readability great even if you have many tickets/task into your board.",0
8252,Trello goes pretty well for small teams.,0
8253,"As your team grows, more than 20 people, I've experienced some problems in keep everything on track.",0
8254,In cases like that Trello may be a problem.,0
8255,What do you dislike?,0
8256,Lack of 'Sprint' control is a real problem.,1
8257,Trello does just a simple and full featured 'kanban'.,0
8258,"If you or your team are Scrum adopters, I would recommend other tools instead of Trello.",1
8259,"Also, there is no simple way to keep a change log; or pack a bunch of tickets into a 'version tag', which may help Software Houses to keep track of their features over the versions.",1

8264,Trello helps people who are looking for a online kanban to share their tasks/tickets with remote teams.,0
8265,A plus is that Trello is totally free.,0
8266,You can pay for some edge features which will be merged into the 'free' plan months later.,0
8267,What do you like best?,0
8268,"For a simple task manager or GTD (""Gettings Things Done"") board, this will probably do the job.",0
8269,The nice thing about Trello is that there's versatility and hidden areas of customization that could optimize Trello for a number of use-cases.,0
8270,"It requires a little research, but there are even chrome extensions that will convert your Trello boards into a more JIRA-like system with burn down timers!",0
8271,"Being able to do things like vote on cards, set due dates, and create checklists are must-haves and Trello has it all!",0
8272,What do you dislike?,0
8273,Two main things.,0
8274,The lesser of the two concerns usability.,0
8275,"Creating a card is simple, requiring only that the user enter text.",0
8276,"Users can click a card (once it's been created) and further customize that card to be a task or user story or whatever, however I wouldn't know that unless I was curious enough to click the card.",0
8277,"Additionally, if a user enters a description for their card, the only way to see it is by clicking the card.",0
8278,"But the interface by then feels cluttered, as it still has all of the other options attached to it.",0
8279,"The second, more concerning thing about Trello is that there is no way to truly work in sprints.",1
8280,"Sure, you can create sprint lists on a board (or even a board per sprint), but it quickly becomes unmanageable if you work in short sprint cycles and/or need to see all completed tasks in an organized way.",1

8282,It's great for simple planning or keeping a backlog.,0
8283,What business problems are you solving?,0

8285,"For my team, we were looking for a cheaper alternative to JIRA.",0
8286,"We needed to be able to have multiple projects organized into sprints, and an efficient way to assign tasks with varying detail levels.",0
8287,"Unfortunately, I don't think Trello satisfies everything for a high-profile business with rapidly evolving products.",0
8288,"However, Trello could certainly be useful to individuals, small teams on a budget, or for projects have long sprint cycles.",0
8289,What do you like best?,0
8290,The visual format of tracking a project.,0
8291,"It's just like I would do in real life, only better.",0
8292,It's like placing post it notes on a big white board and moving them around or removing them when an item is done.,0
8293,What do you dislike?,0
8294,It's hard for new people to get into it right off the bat because it's so different from other PM tools.,0
8295,Most people don't understand the robust features that are underlying it.,0
8296,Or they're overwhelmed by the broadness of it.,0
8297,So as a result others don't want to use it.,0
8298,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
8299,"If you like the idea of a visually-based project management system, you will love Trello.",0
8300,"It's like moving index cards around on a bulletin board, or post-it notes on a whiteboard.",0
8301,But it's very powerful.,0
8302,You can assign due dates and team members.,0
8303,You can see everything you need to do in calendar view.,0
8304,You can duplicate boards for projects you do often.,0
8305,The checklist feature is so helpful.,0
8306,Take some time to dig in and maybe even do a tutorial before you decide whether to use it or not.,0
8307,"It can be overwhelming at first, but if you're a right-brained, visually-oriented person, there is nothing else out there like it.",0
8308,What business problems are you solving?,0
8309,What benefits have you realized?,0
8310,"As a right-brained, creative person, I often find most types of project management really boring and not useful at best, and overwhelming at worst.",0
8311,The benefit for me is that I GET PROJECTS DONE.,0
8312,This is huge!,0
8313,"I have launched multiple websites, programs, books, and more using Trellofor both myself and my clients.",0
8314,What do you like best?,0
8315,"The simplicity and ease of creating and ordering tasks visually into lists, the whole idea of moving tasks between vertical columns is very intuitive and useful.",0
8316,It's really handy when planning sprints and managing a project's lifecycle.,0
8317,It's easily noticeable how much manpower is required (dev wise) for a given sprint or release.,0
8318,"Also, creating dedicated boards for projects and having these various planning/in progress/QA/shipped lists and seeing the overview status of a project and where all of its tasks are, really helps getting a sense of your status.",0
8319,What do you dislike?,0
8320,"It's a bit too simple and lacks various power user capabilities: labeling is nice but too simple and having labels ""move"" between boards makes them prone to ""labels overload"".",1
8321,"Also would have been nice if there were a way to look at tasks differently, not just by lists but by status or some other dimension added to them.. the vertical lists work great most of the time, but other times there's a need to see stuff in a bit more of a ""bird's eye"" overview and Trello is pretty missing this out.",1
8322,Recommendations to others considering the product.,0
8323,"Super easy and efficient way to manage tasks, not so much for product/projects overview (missing a lot of high level management features: status charts, smart status filtering), but worth it overall.",0
8324,What business problems are you solving?,0
8325,What benefits have you realized?,0
8326,"As a product manager and a member in a team which used Trello exclusively for task management, I had to correspond about the status of my own tasks and the ones of the projects I managed.",0

8328,What do you like best?,0
8329,In my company we decided to switch to trello in order to keep track of the failures on our Continuous Integration enviroment.,0
8330,"Before it was a very long process, being done manually, which could be quite tedious when there are 100 failures on different test suites.",0
8331,"We then decided to use the Trello API to write a script which was then integrated with Jenkins: it populates the board moving around failures, existing bugs and so on.",0
8332,It massively increased our productive time during working hours.,0

8340,The features are intuitive and the cards allow for a much more visual approach to managing tasks as opposed to a stagnant list.,0
8341,What do you dislike?,0
8342,We're still figuring out how to use it as a collaborative tool.,0
8343,"At this point, I find it much simpler to use it on my own as a way to manage tasks and items on my 'to-do' and although you can assign cards to particular users, collaborating with my team on it isn't as easy as I'd like it to be.",1
8344,What business problems are you solving?,0
8345,What benefits have you realized?,0
8346,My team utilizes Trello as the editorial calendar for our blog content.,0
8347,Each list represents a week and each card represents a piece of content on a particular day.,0
8348,It's easy to see what's coming up and have a visual representation of the content I need to have ready for the week ahead.,0
8349,The labelling feature is ideal for getting an idea of what I'll be working on at a quick glance too.,0
8350,What do you like best?,0
8351,I love being able to see my tasks progress as they move along from list to list.,0
8352,"I also love that you can move a card or list to different boards, which is not something you can do in PM software like Asana.",0
8353,I also like that you can sync Trello with IFTTT and email to automate some things and that there's so many plugins available.,0
8354,What do you dislike?,0
8355,It's not especially intuitive and I remember having a bit of a slow start.,0
8356,It's hard to have a clear dashboard picture of what you need to get done on bigger projects that will have a lot of smaller tasks associated with it.,1
8357,"You can nest a checklist under a card, but you can't add due dates to items on the checklist.",1

8365,"As a media company, we have several clients that need ever-changing tasks weekly, biweekly and monthly.",0
8366,"Trello was simple compared to other options, and we needed that for the different degrees of experience with knowledge management.",0
8367,What do you dislike?,0
8368,Trello was overwhelming to the team when they first received their cards.,0
8369,"It's one thing to do the work each week, but another thing to actually see how much work you do laid out in a scrolling format.",0

8375,We are solving the problem of remembering tasks and finding a good source to store knowledge management.,0
8376,"This was achieved with Trello and now whenever someone has down time, they can reference their cards to complete another task, ask questions and move on, or write in extra tasks they perform to let upper management know their workload.",0
8377,What do you like best?,0
8378,We are a small software company where everyone wears different hats for multiple projects and serve different roles on different project teams depending on the direction.,0
8379,Trello allows us to track very different types of projects very flexibly depending on the needs of the team and the project.,0
8380,"For example, our support team tracks feature requests from our ticketing system so that when we are looking at building a new core features, we can see how much demand there is and move it over to a core feature board.",0
8381,One of our development teams works independently on an Agile schedule and they track which tasks they have completed so that Product Management can plan release announcements.,0

8429,What do you dislike?,0
8430,I wish that some of the features were a little more 'fleshed out'.,0
8431,If the voting feature allowed you to sort the list be how many votes a card has received for instance that would be a huge boon.,1
