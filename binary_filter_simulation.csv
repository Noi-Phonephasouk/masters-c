1,My company uses JIRA to submit internal tickets for product or component improvements.,0
2,"It is fairly user friendly in terms of submitting requests, I like the ""watcher"" functionality so that you can ""copy"" people on the ticket, and I think the tagging functionality works well.",0
3,"I will say that, while I enjoy the ""watcher"" functionality, it can be difficult to find, as can other functions with JIRA.",1
4,"too many add-ons that should be included Gantt chart, agile boards difficult to use",1
5,dashboard centralized data driven user friendly,0
6,We have kept the app for it's Gantt Charts features which are essential for our work. ,0
7,It's a good way of seeing our work flow.,0
8,Some find it hard to navigate.,1
9,There are such a multitude of different options and tools that it can cover wide range of usage.,0

12,some of the icons can be made more intuitive...do not use dark/thick colors...,1
13,Sometimes the servers are not starting/stopping even after the scheduled time.,1
14,The interface makes it pretty easy to set a schedule and turn off machines off hours.,0
15,I didn't find the mobile version to be as good of an experience as the web version.,1
16,It has the right balance of functionality and simplicity.,0
17,"In some ways it is as simple as making a to do list on paper, yet it has exceptional usability that makes it easy to make changes to the order of tasks or to group them.",0

24,Ease of use and good for tracking project health and timing. ,0
25,The API isn't open enough for us to have a seamless integration between the two.,1

27,A flexibility of tasks views. ,0
28,You can have a deal with numbers and a resource management inside your project management.,0

30,It is a fantastic product which has helped our organization save a lot of money and is very easy to use.,0
31,What I like about it is it's ability to be used for a lot of different things - the user ends up deciding on the best organization of tasks and teams. ,0

33,Easy to use between the app and online content. ,0
34,It all looks fairly similar between the online content and the app which makes locating information quite easy,0
35,I feel like there could be a lot more done with it E.G. Incorporating google docs or something like that into a project.,1
36,It's super easy to add a new task - you can do it in two clicks from any page. ,0
37,"However, it's also complex enough to organize templates, manage schedule and workflow for multiple people and multiple projects, and support multiple kinds of project management methodology.",1

45,"It can organize tasks, schedules, discussions and company files all in one shared place.",0
46,The creation of projects with the ability to assign subtasks and dependencies is a really great feature. ,0
47,"I also really like the ""timeline view"" which enables users to see the progression of a project, including all of the dependencies, so that if something is delayed in the process of a project, we are able to project how much time it will take us to complete the entire project now with these varying components and the change of events / due dates.",0
48,"It does not have a shared calendar for employees to view a daily, monthly or yearly tasks divvied up, and there are no tutorials available online to teach users how to use the app.",1
49,Dashboards and reports help you keep your task organized and your data in hand. ,0
50,"The best thing about it is that it's very user friendly, so it encourages collaboration and you can use it in your laptop or phone.",0
51,It miss important features like to possibility of each user order their projects the way they way.,1
52,The overview options of the projects (timeline is very useful for a visual overview of production),0
53,I liked how you could visually see the status of a project you entered into the system and see how many projects were assigned to co-workers. ,0
54,This allowed us to easily tell who had fewer projects and more time to complete work.,0
55,"It would have been beneficial, especially to help our project managers track progress over time. ",0
56,"Overall, the system was fairly easy to set up and manage.",0
57,I also disliked the number of notifications the system sends for a project.,1
58,"When using the two-step authenticator, I disliked having to open a separate app to receive the code.",1

63,It helps our team stay organized and ensures that our deadlines are met on time.,0
64,"This software is easy to use, keeps tasks on schedule, and allows for ease of communication.",0
65,The only complaint I have is that the view sorts of the tasks could be a little better more like Excel.,1
66,I also wish the project sharing was slightly more intuitive,1
67,"I liked using this software, however, it can become a bit difficult to find files and tasks once they are closed out.",1
68,Not very customizable. Doesn't do time tracking very well.,1
69,"It is fast, responsive, and extremely flexible, serving a variety of different team configurations.",0
70,Things like selecting multiple tasks can become cumbersome. ,1

77,"I have a lot of different projects going on at once, most of the time, and this is very useful.",0
78,It makes working as a remote team so much easier with real time communication and file editing/sharing.,0
79,The only missing element for me was the lack of automatic link between time logged to tasks and time remaining.,1
80,That being said the project team communication and documentation functions were great.,0
81,"It's lacking some features, like a built-in chat app.",1
82,Having dashboards and reports is great.,0

94,"The diverse functionality, easy to use and great interface!",0
95,"beautiful interface, easy to use, very organized, mobile app.",0
96,It is our best tool to organize our business projects by tasks and teams. ,0
97,The mobile app is a great plus that let us take note of our ideas or last minute to-do.,0
98,"It is a very easy to use, drop in, editable platform that we use to create customized splash pages and quotes for specific clients. ",0
99,"I would love the opportunity to have more customizability of the sections, like dropping in an image or a chart next and have text side by side rather than in a separate section below.",1
100,It is a great project management program.,0
101,"I struggle with visibility within a task. Can you create a view where I can see everything below each other, like SmartSheet?",1
102,Sorting function does not automatically sort according to due date.,1
103,"We are really able to successfully delegate, manage, a and execute on deliverables to drive the company towards the business goals.",0
104,Highly customizable and therefore suits almost any given purpose. ,0
105,"Unfortunately, the document preview feature is not there yet. PDF or other complex documents cannot get previewed in the browser or the apps.",1

107,"It use it to incorporate, my business tasks & projects with perosnal tasks and projects so that I have a full view of my day, week, and quarter.",0

111,"I do wish that it was a little easier to use, sometimes I have trouble finding how to do things",1
112,We use this for our development flow and it works great. ,0
113,"The customer support adds bugs, feature requests and more, and the dev team completes them at their pace. ",0
114,It keeps things flowing as smoothly possible.,0
115,"It is a comprehensive way to keep track of my tasks and honestly, to keep me on task!",0
116,It has so far been a great tool and helped keep myself and my teams organized.,0
117,"I like this app, allows me to delegate and keep multiple projects managed with messaging and notes between co-workers.",0
118,Many workmates and I use it often to keep track of projects and ticketing. ,0
119,It is a fantastic system to hold yourself accountable.,0
120,The one drawback I've found is that my preferred time tracking app doesn't integrate with it.,1
121,Does not integrate with google calendar.,1
122,You can easily view tasks that other are working on. ,0
123,I like that you can create sub tasks within your tasks.,0
124,"Sometimes things get lost. I know its because they were not set up correctly, but then we scratch our head to find it.",1

126,Its very easy to use and the ui is awesome i like the User interface.Its easy to track my activities and the Updates .Its easy to track my timesheets,0

143,Organizing your projexct is easy and you easily plan your sprints. ,0
144,I also use the github integration to make tracking work easy,0
145,"It is very slow to load, and it seems to be the kind of software that I feel like can do everything imaginable, but I can't find the buttons to do so. ",1
146,"Most irritating are the varying layouts of tickets in the main view versus the side view that appears after you click the ticket number from a Kanban board or search results page. the smaller, cramped view has more features on it than the main view. this does not seem to be configurable.",1

156,Can't assign multiple people to a single task - have to duplicate the task.,1

158,"API seems unstable at times, requiring a reload when viewing a task",1
159,"It is hard to do parent/child tasks with clear comments, etc. ",1
160,"The way the tasks show up under ""My Tasks"" is hard to understand and complete, so I always have to look at the project view.",1

170,some areas of the software can be slow when running with a lot of data,1
171,Can be complex to configure but once it's configured it's great,1
172,"Good stuff! Very flexible, useful for automation of workflows, among differing teams",0
173,We would also like to see the responsiveness of the cloud version improved.,1
174,"In the user area, there are annoying defects that don't seem to ever be addressed - for example there is no way the order of tickets in an Agile board can be based on the tickets priority, although many users have complained.",1
175,"Unwillingness to sort out issues in the ""too hard"" basket such as permissions and admin usability.",1
176,It is complex to setup and manage.,1
177,Some times hard to find features.,1
178,Some of the admin screens are cumbersome. Especially the field configuration. It is 2016 and we should be able to easily select what fields we want quickly.,1
179,User admin could be more streamlined and intuitive,1
180,Hard to sign in sometimes if you're not using the correct web address.,1

182,This product was very easy to use. ,0

186,There is virtually no way to ensure private conversations are private.,1
187,good experience with agile sw development model good user experience easy to understand easy to follow,0
188,sometimes hard to find the user story i'm looking for.,1
189,personally Jira was a great tool for our dev and product team to collaborate and work together on the sprint planning. ,0
190,"it was easy to tag, see dependencies and track the progress of work. ",0
191,Love the dashboard feature that can be used for a broad overview of the progress on the sprint.,0
192,Our new product development team uses it to facilitate there Agile process.,0
193,"It's very easy to use and to learn, a nice way to use for products, pricing. ",0
194,"If you have a team you can easily to delegate and prioritize what, how, when.",0
195,"It is sometimes TOO feature-rich actually, to the point where it can be confusing to configure.",1
196,I spend most of my working day in the agile boards! So easy to use and endlessly configurable.,0
197,Poor Gantt chart integration (from my perspective) - Hard to get subtasks on scheduled - No project or task templating,1
198,"Deleting tasks can be challenging sometime, especially if it is a nested task.",1
199,"Lacks detailed project planning capabilities (task durations, dependencies, resource requirements, etc.)",1
200,It has been incredibly user-friendly to create tasks and comment on them and really helps our teams to collaborate cross-departmentally.,0
201,"It does not currently have a time management feature, so it is easy to overbook a person with individual tasks.",1
202,JIRA is really difficult to understand and to be properly configured if it doesn’t suit you out of the box.,1
203,"JIRA Agile was first released six years ago, but to this day limitations are visible in the agile management area. We use a Scrumban workflow, which means we lack a planning mode for our Kanban board.",1
204,All great plugins cost money and one can argue that at least parts of their functionality should be included in the core JIRA.,1
207,"Jira is extremly customized if you want for your team or users, but the first setup could be not easy for the beginner.",1
208,UI performance can be improved. It still feels slow even after 5 years of using it.,1
209,It's mobile support is still very limited!,1
211,Test management in JIRA would be awesome.,1
212,It's hard to create new workflow schemes and apply them to some projects (not intuitive).,1
213,"If you want to hide tickets from people who are not concerned (add view restrictions), it's a pain. I had to contact support to set it up correctly.",1
214,Pages loading are slow on the self-hosted version. It may due to sharing of resources across all customers.,1
215,Useful for project management but not flexible enough to effectively use for other purposes.,1
216,The search function is poor.,1
217,JIRA's graphs and charts are not super intuitive to set up to get sophisticated analyses on pain points in the project life cycle.,1
218,Some features like filtering require a bit of tech savvy knowledge to use fully.,1
219,"JIRA is very good at helping us manage small, executable development tasks, but it does not meet the need of understanding the full scope of an “Epic” (big project).",1
220,The sync between JIRA and Zendesk's support site could be better.,1
221,"JIRA has a great UI, but some clicks could be reduced in some areas by allowing lists to be editable without having to actually go into the tickets.",1
222,"Email notifications can be overwhelming if a developer is plowing through a list of your tickets. Would be better if JIRA sent an update summary email every hour or so, instead of an update for each ticket.",1
223,Moving tickets across different stages on a board can be a little cumbersome as tickets can sometimes not update properly and require intervention on the ticket itself.,1
224,I'd like to see more creative widgets for the dashboard. Don't have any specific ideas but more options around metrics would be awesome.,1
225,The new version of JIRA is a bit slow and not responsive.,1
227,A click here and there leads to opening a small window for adding comments which can be irritating and cumbersome sometimes.,1
228,"The Upload attachment allows us to add requirements, design documents or snapshots. But there is no way you can search or find based on the attachments. Once the JIRA issues are implemented, its very hard to go to each and every JIRA and search for the requirement and design documents. If there is any way, JIRA will have option to show the JIRA number and corresponding attachment when searching through filters, that will help.",1
